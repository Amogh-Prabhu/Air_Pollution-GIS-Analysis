During the last meetup event of [GeoHYD](https://www.meetup.com/GeoHYD/events/255665421/) at Gramener, we created Division level maps for 16 Indian states based on the 2011 census maps.

Districts are grouped as Divisions in most states. We've ignored those states that donâ€™t have or don't report divisions.

Division level maps are useful for government officials to track performance indicators across sectors as part of their administrative duties.

We're releasing these maps for public use.

The curious can refer [the tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MVF7sIh3GChQiS60pHs3hUP0RW3EPRqus72aGQ-DFeo/edit?usp=sharing) used to create these maps.

For queries, please contact [Bhanu K](talk2kish@gmail.com).

Notes:

- Properties are not consistent across these files. Please ignore everything other than state and division names.
