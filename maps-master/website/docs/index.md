# Community Created Maps of India

Community Created Maps of India sourced from different government websites which are freely available to all the 
Indians. Here we have digitized them, cleaned them, added appropriate attributes so it can be used by all the 
researchers, students etc.:

All the boundaries are available in geojson or shapefile (WGS84, EPSG4326) format. The below table gives you the 
status of the data as we clean and upload. Data is not perfect there as many errors both in data and boundaries. 
You can contribute by sending the pull requests. Please use the census names when correcting the attributes and 
geojson for shapes. Refer [CONTRIBUTING](./contributing) for ways to contribute.
